# Overview

This is a personal project that I intend to build out a little in the coming weeks. It has to be done by December 1st.

It will contain 24 riddles on individual pages that "open" one by one on the days leading up to christmas to give Hanna something fun to do every day until christmas. If she completes a riddle, the door opens and she gets her gift for the day.
